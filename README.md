### Courserank Scraper

On October 13, Chegg announced that they were (shutting down Courserank)[http://www.stanforddaily.com/2014/11/07/goodbye-courserank/]. There is obviously a wealth of information on the site that would be nice to have around. This scraper is the result of my work in keeping as much data as possible, in order to seed a new website (announcement coming soon!)

#### Requirements

This script uses the following gems

* highline - user input made easier
* mechanize - headless browsing
* mongo - Ruby API for storage in MongoDB
* nokogiri - XML parsing
